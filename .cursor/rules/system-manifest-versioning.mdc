---
# System Reminder VERY IMPORTANT

Always track your edits and update the extension version in [manifest.json](mdc:manifest.json).

## When to bump version
- Any user-visible change to UI, text, behavior, or output
- Any change to background, content scripts, popup, options, or permissions
- Any new file in `src/**`, or changes to build output naming in `vite.config.js`

## Versioning rule (SemVer)
- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Default bump: PATCH for fixes and small UI tweaks
- MINOR for new features or new UI sections
- MAJOR for breaking changes or permission scope changes

## Required steps per change
1. Update `version` in [manifest.json](mdc:manifest.json)
2. Build with Bun: `bun run build`
3. Verify `dist/manifest.json` contains the new version
4. Load/Reload unpacked extension and sanity-check
5. Note the change in [README.md](mdc:README.md) and/or `Docs/Guide.md`

## Additional checks
- Ensure `manifest_version` remains 3
- Check `content_scripts` matches/run_at after edits
- Keep permissions minimal and consistent with code
- Confirm Vite static copy includes [manifest.json](mdc:manifest.json)

## Commit template
```

- Brief: what changed
